<p>During our Unit 6 meeting, our primary focus in the first meeting was on establishing a strong foundation for our projects and gaining a clear understanding of the objectives ahead. One of the topics we explored was the potential impact of an online presence on business growth, which I was assigned to further investigate. Based on the meeting notes, I conducted research to determine the feasibility of achieving a 50% growth in business through an online presence, emphasizing the importance of effective implementation strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to our research tasks, our team worked together to outline the initial steps necessary for our projects. We emphasized the importance to establish precise objectives, recognize possible obstacles, and create plans to minimize risks. We also assigned responsibilities and established communication channels on Discord to ensure seamless coordination throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unit 6 was a critical phase in our project journey, providing us with a solid foundation to build upon and evolve our ideas. By delving into topics such as the potential impact of online presence on business growth, we gained valuable insights that would guide our decision-making and strategic planning moving forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Unit 6 marked the beginning of our collaborative efforts, laying the groundwork for the subsequent phases of our projects. It allowed us to brainstorm ideas, conduct preliminary research, and establish a robust framework for our endeavors. As we transitioned into Unit 11, we reflected on our progress since Unit 6 and evaluated the evolution of our projects using our initial aspirations and objectives.</p>
