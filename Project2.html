       <p><strong>Overview of Unit 11</strong></p>
<p>In Unit 11, my primary focus was on addressing the digitalization initiatives proposed by Pampered Pets, particularly concerning the introduction of an international supply chain and automated warehouses worldwide. Additionally, I worked on producing an Executive Summary to estimate the probabilities associated with the potential risks to both the quality and availability of the company's products due to these changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executive Summary:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identification of Risks: I enumerated potential risks to the quality and supply chain of the company, considering the implications of the proposed digitalization changes. This involved assessing the selection of quantitative risk modeling approaches to justify the chosen method.</p>
<p>Quantitative Modeling: I explained the calculations carried out, including detailed assumptions and sources of data utilized.</p>
<p>Results and Recommendations: Based on the quantitative models employed, I summarized the results and provided recommendations regarding the potential risk of loss of quality and supply chain issues. This included assessing the probability of occurrence for each identified risk and offering actionable insights to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p>Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: In response to Ms. O&rsquo;dour's suggestion, I worked on designing a business continuity/disaster recovery (DR) strategy to ensure the continuous operation of the online presence in the event of a disaster affecting the physical premises.</li>
<li>Key Considerations: I considered the requirement for the online shop to be available 24/7/365 with minimal downtime and data loss. This involved proposing Oracle solutions with less than a 1-minute changeover window and minimal data loss tolerance.</li>
<li>Platform Selection and Vendor Lock-in: Furthermore, I recommended a suitable platform to host the DR solution, considering factors such as reliability, scalability, and vendor lock-in concerns. This recommendation was informed by a thorough analysis of relevant sources to ensure alignment with the organization's needs and goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, my contributions in Unit 11 focused on addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by Pampered Pets&rsquo; digitalization initiatives, while also ensuring the resilience and continuity of the business operations in the face of potential disruptions. Through rigorous analysis and strategic recommendations, I aimed to support the organization in navigating the complexities of digital transformation while safeguarding its core objectives and values.</p>
