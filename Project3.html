  <p><strong>Evaluation of Unit 6 and Unit 11 projects</strong></p>
<p>Unit 6 Project Evaluation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Unit 6, our project primarily focused on laying the groundwork for Pampered Pets&rsquo; digitalization process. Our discussions centered around the potential impact of establishing an online presence on business growth. While the initial focus was on exploring opportunities, the project lacked detailed Compliance and concrete action plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiation of Ideas: The project kickstarted our exploration of Pampered Pets&rsquo; digitalization plans, setting the stage for further development.</li>
<li>Collaborative Effort: Team members actively contributed to discussions and research tasks, demonstrating strong collaboration and engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Areas for Improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of Depth: The project lacked detailed compliance and actionable plans, with a focus on exploring opportunities rather than concrete strategies.</li>
<li>Limited Scope: The project primarily focused on the potential benefits of digitalization without delving into potential risks or challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unit 11 Project Evaluation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unit 11 denoted a significant step forward from the primary exploration stages towards the execution and assessment of Pampered Pets' digitalization initiatives. The focus of the project was on creating an Executive Summary that would estimate the likelihoods associated with probable risks to the quality and availability of the company's products due to digitalization changes. Furthermore, it involved developing a business continuity/disaster recovery (DR) strategy to ensure uninterrupted operations of the online presence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed Analysis: To evaluate potential risks associated with digitalization changes, the project involved a comprehensive analysis and quantitative modeling. This provided valuable insights into decision-making purposes.</li>
<li>Strategic Recommendations: The Executive Summary included actionable recommendations that showcased a proactive approach to risk management. The recommendations helped mitigate the identified risks.</li>
<li>Practical Solutions: A business continuity/DR strategy was designed to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the online presence, reflecting a thorough understanding of business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Areas for Improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of Perspectives: While the project addresses technical aspects and risk management strategies, there is a need for further integration of customer perspectives and stakeholder considerations.</li>
    <li>Communication of Findings: The Executive Summary's findings and recommendations could have a greater impact and usability for stakeholders if the clarity and accessibility of the information were enhanced.</li>
</ul>
